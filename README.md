  <h1>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„</h1>
</div>

Welcome to my github profile: a sandbox where I post most of my code for collaborating, archiving, and syncing. 

I am studying Mathematicsâž• and Computer ScienceðŸ–¥ in the University of Waterloo!

### What I Love Writing

My favourite language has to be C/C++. I love staying close to the hardware and building fast applications. I am, of course, also skilled in Python and Javascript.

### What I'm Working On Right Now ðŸ“š

Right now I am working on low-level and embedded code. Always up for suggestions or invites to collab!
