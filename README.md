  <h1>Hello! 👋😄</h1>

Welcome to my github profile: a sandbox where I post most of my code for collaborating, archiving, and syncing. 

I am studying Mathematics➕ and Computer Science🖥 in the University of Waterloo!

### What I'm Learning Right Now 📚

Right now I am working on learning Machine Learning, specifically Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks.

### What I Enjoyed Working on the Most ✍️

I would say my most enjoyable project was definitely working on the CCC with two of my friends. That was the first time I gave competitive programming a go, and I have to say the format is very addicting. Together we solved more than a decade's problems, and I learnt so much about optimisation and problem solving along the way.

### What I Want to Work on in the Future 🤔

There's a lot of technologies on the horizon right now. WebAssembly looks strong as ever, Microsoft's .NET MAUI looks elegant and powerful.

I would say the one thing I want to learn more than anything however is Haskell. After using Racket and even React-Web, I have grown to love the paradigm of having pure functions. And I feel as though I should embrace it fully. Haskell and functional programming both deeply interest me, and I am excited to see the future of the functional paradigm.
