# hello! üëã

Welcome to my github profile: a sandbox where I dump most of my code for collaborating, archiving, and syncing. 

I am just a HS studentüéì for now, hoping to study Mathematics‚ûï and Computer Scienceüñ• in college, but I have spent the past few years teaching myself multiple languages, technologies, and techniques for writing somewhat good code. 

I am always learning new things and trying to write better code everytime I open up my editor. What excites me is how Programming and Computer Science are vast fields with new developments nearly everyday, so there's always something for me to sink my teeth into.


### what I'm learning right now üßê

I have been a Vim user for a while now, and have fallen in love with the command shell. The issue is, Emac's org-mode is just too tempting. And neovim's org-mode plugin isn't quite done yet. So for the past few weeks I have been trying to learn Emacs (specifically Doom because Evil mode is a godsend). Emacs, due to having way more features baked in than Vim, is a bit hard to wrap my head around, but after reading the manual for the third time, I think I'm starting to get it. Will upload my configuration soon-ish.

### what I enjoyed working on the most

I would say my most enjoyable project was definitely working on the CCC with two of my friends. That was the first time I gave competitive programming a go, and I have to say the format is very addicting. Together we solved more than a decade's problems, and I learnt so much along the way. Unfortunately we weren't able to crack the S5 tier of problems, but that just gives me more motivation to better myself as a programmer.  :D



### what I want to work on in the future 

There's a lot of technologies on the horizon right now. WebAssembly looks strong as ever, Microsoft's .NET MAUI looks elegant and powerful - plus I love C# so would take any excuse to write more of it - and it seems like everyday there is a Javascript framework. 

I would say the one thing I want to learn more than anything however is a purely functional programming language, like Haskell. After using React-Web, I have grown to love the functional paradigm of having pure functions. To the point where I feel as though I should take the leap of faith, and embrace it fully. Plus I have heard that haskell makes you a better programmer, and I wanna see what the fuss is about.
