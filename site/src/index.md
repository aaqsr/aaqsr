## About { #about }

I'm a fourth-year Mathematics and Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, and I am specialising in Digital Hardware.

My work spans computer graphics, concurrent embedded systems, and low-level programming. From simulating fluids in real-time, to writing C++ for projection mapping computer vision systems, to building custom SPI drivers for STM32 microcontrollers.

I'm drawn to problems that sit at the intersection of hardware and software, where performance matters and every cycle counts. Systems that are both mathematically rigorous and practically useful. I believe the best engineering happens when you understand the problem from first principles, then build elegant solutions that scale.

## Experience { #experience }

Since September, I've been working at Huawei as a Software Engineering Co-op. I'm part of the **Data and Privacy Protection Lab**, where I'm researching optimisations for the compiler that handles Access Control Policy scripts in the HarmonyOS kernel.

Previously, I was a Software Engineering Co-op on the **Projection Mapping** team at Christie Digital Systems. There, I worked on production systems that demand precision and are driven by a lovely old, mature, legacy C++ code-base. I characterised some computer vision algorithms, extended binary encoders to communicate with projectors for multi-colour projection, and researched solutions to optical distortion errors in sensors with some Python data analysis.

I have also served as a **Software Engineering Teaching Assistant** at Waterloo, maintaining Linux server infrastructure and teaching C++ and object-oriented design to second-year students. And I once worked as a **Full-Stack Developer** at Expresume, where I built backend systems with PostgreSQL and AWS.

Beyond the classroom, I've been **President of the Mathematics Society**, representing over 7,000 students and managing a $100,000 budget, and I'm an active **Editor at mathNEWS**, Waterloo's beloved campus publication.

## Selected Projects { #projects }

**Water Simulation Engine** — Built a real-time fluid dynamics system using OpenGL and C++. Utilised the shallow water equations to create a height-field simulation and added interaction with rigid bodies. The project also features a physics engine built from scratch with an inertia tensor integrator and bounding box collisions. ***See a demo video and more [here](/courses/cs488/).***

**Handheld Game Console** — Designed and built from scratch using an STM32 MCU, complete with custom 3D-printed housing. Wrote embedded C++ with a custom event loop architecture and SPI display driver optimised for partial rendering and power efficiency.

**Lambda Calculus Interpreter** — Implemented a complete interpreter supporting currying, Y-combinator recursion, and alpha-beta reduction. Featured a custom linear memory allocator designed for performance and memory safety in functional language evaluation.

## Get in Touch { #contact }

I'm always interested in discussing interesting problems, whether that is embedded systems, multithreading and concurrency, computer graphics, or really anything in mathematics or engineering.

Currently I am also seeking co-op opportunities for **Summer 2026** (i.e. start of May till end of August). I'm particularly drawn to roles involving systems programming, computer graphics, FPGA development, or any work that lets me solve high-level problems whilst staying close to hardware.

Priorities for me when job-seeking include (*in order!*) great and interesting,

1. people,
2. problems, and
3. poutine.
